# monthly_challenges

Project created to exercise Python Django from the online course Python Django - The Practical Guide (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-the-practical-guide)

I abandoned this course as it was not focused on Python Django REST API.

Then I started a course focused on backend called Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced (https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced)

The repo for the exercises practiced on this new course is: https://github.com/ArthurKretzer/recipe-app-api
